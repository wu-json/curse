Curse is a dead simple Terminal UI for running processes, configurable through incantations in a single `curse.toml` file.

## Installation & Setup

Curse is a single binary and it's _definitely lightweight._ Not like bun is bundled in there or anything.

1. `brew install curse`

2. Create your `curse.toml` and put it in your project root.

```toml
# curse.toml example
[[process]]
name = "db-migrate"
command = "bun run examples/large/db-migrate.ts"

[[process]]
name = "seed-data"
command = "bun run examples/large/seed-data.ts"
deps = ["db-migrate"]

[[process]]
name = "database"
command = "bun run examples/large/mock-database.ts"
deps = ["seed-data"]

[[process]]
name = "api-server"
command = "bun run examples/large/api-server.ts"
env = { PORT = 8001, SERVICE_NAME = "API Server" }
readiness_probe = { type = "http", host = "127.0.0.1", path = "/health", port = 8001 }
deps = ["seed-data"]
```

3. Run `curse`.

> [!NOTE]
> Curse will select a configuration file with the following priority from highest to lowest:
>
> `[override with -p flag]` > `curse.local.toml` > `curse.toml`.

## The Origin Story

_Local development feels like a very special curse at times._ Just like these kind caring friends on the right.

If you've been writing code for a while, you're likely no stranger to the sacred art that is reading unmaintained instructions in the company `README.md`.

```
## Starting Application Locally

# start local pg and redis
docker compose up

# build everything in monorepo
pnpm build:all

# start local dev server
pnpm start:dev:local

# start client app
cd app/client yarn start

# start
```

If the above made you cringe, then you're not alone because many others have too. Existing solutions to this problem have come in various forms. 

- [s(hell) Scripts](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/shell-scripts/): How do you view the ongoing output of each process?. You could hook into TMux or Wezterm panes but that isn't ideal for everyone.

- [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose): Requires containerizing all local resources for your application. Not ideal unless you have a neckbeard.

- [process-compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose): Has a lot of features I don't use and feels sluggish.

Out of all of the options above, `process-compose` got the closest to the experience I wanted but was still far from it. It felt pretty slow, had limited tooling around logging, and resulted in composed configuration files that were annoying to debug and maintain.

## Goals For Curse


# Features Planned

- [ ] Support user input in the log view
- [ ] Dump logs to files
