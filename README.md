Curse is a dead simple Terminal UI for running processes, configured through a single `curse.toml` file.

## Installation & Setup

Curse is a single binary and it's _definitely lightweight._ Not like I shoved bun in there or anything. 

1. Install the [wu-json/cursed-tools](https://github.com/wu-json/cursed-tools) Aqua registry. After installing the `cursed-tools` Aqua registry, curse should be available via `aqua g -i`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven't used [aqua](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua) before, now is a good time to start.

2. Create your `curse.toml` and put it in your project root.

```toml
# curse.toml example
version = 0

[[process]]
name = "db-migrate"
command = "bun run examples/large/db-migrate.ts"

[[process]]
name = "seed-data"
command = "bun run examples/large/seed-data.ts"
deps = [{ name = "db-migrate", condition = "succeeded" }]

[[process]]
name = "database"
command = "bun run examples/large/mock-database.ts"
deps = [{ name = "seed-data", condition = "succeeded" }]

[[process]]
name = "api-server"
command = "bun run examples/large/api-server.ts"
env = { PORT = 8001, SERVICE_NAME = "API Server" }
readiness_probe = { type = "http", host = "127.0.0.1", path = "/health", port = 8001 }
deps = [{ name = "database", condition = "ready" }]

# Optional lifecycle hooks (note that these are both blocking)
[hooks]
startup = { name = "setup", command = "echo 'Setting up environment...'" }
shutdown = { name = "cleanup", command = "echo 'Cleaning up...'" }
```

3. Run `curse`.

> [!NOTE]
> Curse will select a configuration file with the following priority from highest to lowest:
>
> `[override with -p flag]` > `curse.local.toml` > `curse.toml`.

## The Origin Story

_Local development feels like a very special curse at times._ Just like these kind caring friends on the right.

If you've been writing code for a while, you're likely no stranger to the sacred art that is reading unmaintained instructions in the company `README.md`.

## Starting Application Locally

# start local pg and redis
docker compose up

# watch everything in monorepo
pnpm watch:all

# start local dev server
pnpm start:dev:local

# start client app
cd app/client yarn start
```

<td style="vertical-align: middle; padding-left: 20px;">

If the above made you cringe, then you're not alone because many others have too. Existing solutions to this problem have come in various forms. 

- [s(hell) Scripts](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/shell-scripts/): How do you view the ongoing output of each process?. You could hook into TMux or Wezterm panes but that isn't ideal for everyone.

- [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose): Requires containerizing all local resources for your application. Not ideal unless you have a neckbeard.

- [process-compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose): Has a lot of features I don't use and feels sluggish.

Out of all of the options above, `process-compose` got the closest to the experience I wanted but was still far from it. It felt quite slow, had limited tooling around logging, and resulted in composed configuration files that were unpleasant to maintain. 

## Design Principles

### Simplicity: Focus on the Local Development Use-Case

Scoping curse to the local development script use-case means we can drop a lot of the beefier orchestration features that `process-compose` has (e.g. replicas, process forking, etc.). This keeps the feature-set of curse minimal and allows us to focus on a relatively simple DX.

### Make Interacting with Logs Delightful

Local logs are really useful, and are often the reason we want to run things locally in the first place. Navigating and interacting with logs should feel like a first-class experience.

### Familiarity

Coming from `k9s`, constantly having to context switch shortcuts between `k9s` and `process-compose` was unpleasant, especially given that they look so similar. The key-binds in curse are meant to feel warm and familiar such that anyone using vim motions should feel right at home.
