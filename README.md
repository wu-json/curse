## Specs
- Should use simple toml file for configuration; no overlays
- Should have simple start and restart capability
- Should have ability to view and search output
- Should have easy shutdown pattern
- Should report process status (exit code)
- UI-wise would prefer something k9s style as opposed to process-compose; actually enter into a process to see logs

# Stretch Specs
- Dependencies; readiness probes
