Curse is a dead simple Terminal UI for running processes.

Local development often feels like a very special curse. If you've been writing code for a while, you are probably no stranger to instructions like this:

```
## Starting Application Locally

# start local pg and redis
docker compose-up

# build everything in monorepo
pnpm build:all

# start local dev server
pnpm start:dev:local

# start client app
cd app/client yarn start

# start
```

If the above instructions made you cringe, then this project might be useful for you.
